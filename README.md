# Python Code of RTSP/MJPG Video with AI Bounding Box Display for LILIN YOLO Camera

LILIN 7 series cameras are using Ambarella CV series, CV22/CV25 VPU and running Yolo for AI recognition.  The purpose of the Python code is to use OpenCV, CV2 library, for showing RTSP/MJPG video from LILIN IP camera via RTSP port.  It also connects to LILIN AI port at 8592 for AI bounding boxes and license plate recognition.
